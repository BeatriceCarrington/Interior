Tools in making a model for Interior design	
========


For an interior designer like me, itâ€™s very important to me to make a model first as a representation of what my final product will be look like. 

So here are some of the tools I used in making a model for my interior design: Floor Planner, an online modelling tool offering both 2D and 3D views, IKEA Planner for the kitchen views, Colorjive which I considered very important to know which color suits your place and your personality too, I also used Autodesk Homestyler, SeeMyDesign, [payday loans uk](http://www.treehouseloans.co.uk/), Sweet Home 3D, Live Interior 3D and Google Sketchup where I can design my own concept architecture, shed, interiors or even vehicles with it.
